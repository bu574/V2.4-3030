# V2.4-3030

This is work in progress - some parts need still to be improved.

I had a Hevo, that i didnt like that much since i built 3 Vorons from Formbot Kits.
Because I like the 3030 frame of the Hevo, as well as tinkering around, I decided to transform the Hevo into a Voron V2.4.
At first I thought I could reuse many parts from the Hevo including the electronics - but after a lot of 'try and erroing', I came to the conclusion that the only usable parts from the former Hevo printer is the 3030 frame and the MGN12 rails for Z.
So in the end, this is not only a conversion of my good old Hevo, but my first self sourced V2.4 as well ;) 


I will create a BOM in the future, so it will be a lot easier for others that may want to convert their Hevo as well.

Gantry is still built with 2020 extrusions, because i dont see any advantages for this to be built with 3030s.
I had to customize all printed parts that touches the frame, and many parts of the gantry (whole print head parts are untouched)

The mods i used (and may have customized to fit the 3030 extrusions):

  -  Annex Panel Clips (and corners): https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Annex-Engineering_User_Mods/tree/main/Printers/All_Printers/annex_dev-Panel_2020_Clips_and_Hinges/panel_clips_and_corners
